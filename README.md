## Leapkit Core
**Leapkit Core** is a Go web framework library that provides essential building blocks for building web applications. It's designed to be a lightweight, modular foundation with clean APIs and sensible defaults.

## 🏗️ Core Components

### Server Module (`server/`)
- HTTP server with routing capabilities
- Middleware support
- Session management 
- Error handling with templating support
- Built on top of standard Go `net/http`

### Database Module (`db/`)
- Database connection management
- Support for SQLite and PostgreSQL
- Database migration system
- Database creation utilities

### Rendering Engine (`render/`)
- Template rendering system using Plush templating engine
- Support for layouts and partials
- File system-based template loading
- Context-aware rendering

### Form Handling (`form/`)
- Form data decoding using `github.com/go-playground/form`
- Form validation system
- HTTP request form processing

### Tools (`tools/`)
- Environment variable loading utilities

## 🎯 Purpose

This library serves as a foundational component for the Leapkit ecosystem - a Go-based web framework that aims to provide:

- **Simplicity**: Clean, straightforward APIs for common web development tasks
- **Modularity**: Each component can be used independently 
- **Convention over Configuration**: Sensible defaults (like `app/layouts/application.html` for layouts)
- **Database Agnostic**: Support for multiple database systems
- **Modern Go Practices**: Uses Go 1.22+ and follows contemporary Go patterns

## 📦 Dependencies

The project uses minimal, well-established dependencies:
- **Plush**: For templating (from Buffalo ecosystem)
- **Gorilla Sessions**: For session management
- **SQLite3**: For database support
- **go-playground/form**: For form processing

## 🚀 Usage

This library is designed to be imported as `go.leapkit.dev/core` and used to build larger web applications or other Leapkit components. Each module can be used independently or together to create full-featured web applications.

```go
import (
    "go.leapkit.dev/core/server"
    "go.leapkit.dev/core/render"
    "go.leapkit.dev/core/db"
)
```
